                    <p>Since I was a child, I have aspired to be a professional football player and create a great legacy in my career. Playing football with my friends has always been my favorite activity since childhood, and when I turned 12, I began training with a professional coach. My personal coach has assisted me in learning the fundamental skills and tactics of football. Throughout time, with the combination of my natural talent, I have become an exceptional skilled player. At the age of 17, I became a member of my hometown's professional football team, Bishoftu Kenema Football Club. After a week of trial, I was selected by the club head coach and started playing for the reserve team immediately. I have excelled in my role and contributed to the team's success by winning several games. In the following year, I signed up for another local football team, Defence University Football Club, in my hometown. From the start of playing for the first team, I managed to score many goals. At the moment, I am working hard both with my team and individually. With my current performance, I am confident that I can compete at a higher level. At the moment, I am searching for a trial opportunity abroad, and I am prepared to showcase my potential to the world.
